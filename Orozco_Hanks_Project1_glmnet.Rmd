```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

## Setup

```{r}
# add your libraries

# Modeling packages
library(glmnet)   # for implementing regularized regression
library(caret)    # for automating the tuning process

library(tidyverse)




wine = read_rds("pinot.rds")

```


## Feature Engineering

```{r}
# create some cool features. Make sure you add comments so I know what you are trying to accomplish!

wine_words <- function(df, j = 1000, stem=F){ 
  library(tidytext)
  library(SnowballC)
  data(stop_words)
  
  words <- df %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, description) %>%
    anti_join(stop_words) %>% # get rid of stop words
    filter(!(word %in% c("wine","pinot","vineyard", "price", "points")))
  
  if(stem){
    words <- words %>% 
      mutate(word = wordStem(word))
  }
  
  words <- words %>% 
    count(id, word) %>% 
    group_by(id) %>% 
    mutate(exists = (n>0)) %>% 
    ungroup %>% 
    group_by(word) %>% 
    mutate(total = sum(n)) %>% 
    filter(total > j) %>% 
    pivot_wider(id_cols = id, names_from = word, values_from = exists, values_fill = list(exists=0)) %>% 
    right_join(select(df,id,province)) %>% 
    mutate(across(-province, ~replace_na(.x, F)))
}

wino <- wine_words(wine, j=200, stem=F)

#bringing back numerical features from original dataset to wino:
wino = wino %>% left_join(select(wine, id, price, points, year), by = "id") 
  
#center and scale points: 
wino = wino %>% select(points) %>% preProcess(method = c("center", "scale")) %>% predict(wino)

#creating year as factor feature, logprice: 
wino = wino %>% mutate(lprice = log(price))


#removing original price                    
wino = wino %>% select(-price)


```



## Specification

```{r}
#Model: ELASTIC NET REGRESSION
#Tuning parameters: 
#   1. lambda - regularization/penalty enforcement to minimize prediction error)
#   2, alpha  - mixing parameter between 0 and 1, where alpha = 0 is ridge regression, and alpha = 1 is lasso regression)

set.seed(504) 

ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)

wine_index <- createDataPartition(wino$province, p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
train <- wino[ wine_index, ]
test <- wino[-wine_index, ]
```



```{r}
fit <- train(province ~ .,
             data = train, 
             method = "glmnet",
             tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha=seq(0,1,length=10),
                                    lambda = seq(0.0001,0.2,
                                    length=20)),
             trControl = ctrl,
             metric = "Kappa")

confusionMatrix(predict(fit, test),factor(test$province))


```





## Best model

```{r}
# Here are a few lines to inspect your best model. Add some comments about optimal hyperparameters.
print(fit)
print(fit$bestTune)

```


## Re-fit and evaluation

```{r}
# the "method" below should match the one you chose above. 
set.seed(504) # I will choose a different seed for evaluation

wine_index <- createDataPartition(wino$province, p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
train <- wino[ wine_index, ]
test <- wino[-wine_index, ]

# example spec for glmnet
fit_final <- train(province ~ .,
             data = train, 
             method = "glmnet",
             tuneGrid=fit$bestTune) 
# The last line means we will fit a model using the best tune parameters your CV found above.

confusionMatrix(predict(fit_final, test),factor(test$province))
```
